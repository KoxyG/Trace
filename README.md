## Decentralized Web3 Wallet Proof-of-Funds DApp for Web3 Ladies Hackathon Built on solana.

This decentralized application (DApp) aims to provide users with a secure and convenient way to generate proofs of funds using their Web3 wallets. It facilitates the generation, verification, and sharing of cryptographic proofs for specified amounts of cryptocurrencies. The DApp consists of several pages and functionalities, each designed to fulfill specific user requirements.

## Features

1. **Connect Wallet Page:**
   - Securely connect web3 wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.
   - Clear layout with wallet selection options.
   - User feedback during the connection process.
   - Ability to disconnect wallets with confirmation.

2. **Proof Generation Page:**
   - Specify the amount and type of cryptocurrency for proof.
   - User-friendly layout with input validation.

 
3. **Proof Verification Page (In-Progress):**
   - Display generated proofs clearly.
   - text document representation of proof details.
   - Initiate proof verification with confirmation.
   - Loading indicator and verification status display.

4. **Download/Share Page
   - Download proof in PDF format.
   - Generate time-limited shareable links for the proof.
   - 
6. **General Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Responsive design across different devices.
   - Clear feedback for user interactions.
   - Prioritize user privacy and employ best security practices.
   - User-friendly error handling and testing for smooth operation.
  
## Future Development

- **Optional explanations of zero-knowledge proofs.**
  - Provide users with clear explanations of zero-knowledge proofs to enhance understanding.
